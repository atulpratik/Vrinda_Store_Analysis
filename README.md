## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis using Excel, which involves manipulating and organizing data to derive meaningful insights. The project includes creating additional columns as required, performing analysis, generating visualizations, and generating a report based on the findings.

## Data

The project utilizes an Excel file as the data source. The file contains the data that needs to be analyzed.

## Analysis

The data analysis process involves various steps, including but not limited to:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensure the data is consistent, remove any duplicates, and handle missing values appropriately.
2. **Column Creation:** Create new columns based on the analysis requirements to facilitate calculations and visualizations.
3. **Data Manipulation:** Perform calculations, aggregations, and transformations to extract relevant insights from the data.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Apply statistical techniques, such as averages, correlations, or regression, to uncover patterns or relationships in the data.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in presenting the analyzed data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. The project utilizes various chart types, including:

1. **Bar Charts:** Used to display categorical data and compare values across different categories.
2. **Pie Charts:** Utilized to represent the composition or distribution of data as a proportion of a whole.
3. **Pivot Charts:** Created based on pivot tables, allowing for dynamic analysis and visual representation of summarized data.

These visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the data and highlight key findings and trends.
